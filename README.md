This is just an ongoing personal project to track basketballs through the air with computer vision. There is also some camera calibration being done by detecting the level of deformation of the rim, the actual object detection, and then fitting a parabola along the ball's path.

Then end goal is to use a cheap webcam to actually keep track of why/how shots are being missed, so that players can have a more concrete strategy to improve than "stop missing".

As things currently stand, this repository is not implemented to be used (and hence I have not acquired a license). The goal is simply to showcase how the project is coming along via images and videos I have created using the code. I appologize in advance if anyon tries reading the code.

Over the coming weeks, I plan on commenting, formatting and documenting the code.
